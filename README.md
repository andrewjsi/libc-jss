# JSS C Library

This library contains the C functions and macros, which are often used in our
projects. In the future, this will be a stand-alone library with unit tests and
documentation.

[AMISMS](https://github.com/andrewjsi/amisms) and [libamievent](https://github.com/andrewjsi/libamievent) uses this library.

## Source code

The source code is well written as far as possible. We do not use tabs, instead
of 4 spaces is indented. All identifiers, including variables, function names
and macros written in English, but some comments and commits in Hungarian is,
because we are speaking and thinking in Hungarian. Nevertheless, we try to
write everything in English in the future.

## Contribution

It is an open source project, which is to be better and better. If you have any
ideas or find an error, or get stuck, you can contact us, please file a bug
report or send a pull-request!
